Figure~\ref{fig:bubble_tradeoff} shows how diagnostic accuracy relates to overall trust.
All systems achieved similar accuracy, but their trust scores were very different.
The \textbf{Baseline} and \textbf{Consensus} setups scored lower on trust (FTI around 35â€“39) because they lacked active safety checks.
In contrast, the \textbf{Safety} and \textbf{Trust} systems reached much higher FTI values (around 75) by actively identifying and preventing unsafe actions.
This result shows that real trust comes from how a system reasons and behaves, not just from how accurate its answers are.
