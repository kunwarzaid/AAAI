Reasoning-trace statistics (Figure~\ref{fig:reasoning_quality}) reveal complementary strengths across configurations.  
\textbf{Safety} and \textbf{Trust} generated the longest reasoning chains (roughly 300â€“350 tokens), reflecting explicit verification and safety dialogues.  
\textbf{Consensus}, although producing shorter traces, showed the highest coherence (RDC = 73.8) and evidence coverage, albeit with greater redundancy due to inter-agent debate.  
These findings indicate that consensus mechanisms encourage reflective reasoning and internal agreement, while safety agents promote careful verification even at the cost of brevity.
