Reasoning-trace statistics (Figure~\ref{fig:reasoning_quality}) show different strengths for each configuration.
The \textbf{Safety} and \textbf{Trust} setups produced the longest reasoning chains (about 300â€“350 tokens), since both include extra steps for checking and verifying decisions.
The \textbf{Consensus} setup created shorter reasoning traces but achieved the highest coherence (RDC = 73.8) and strong evidence coverage.
However, it also showed more repetition because multiple agents discussed similar points.
Overall, consensus reasoning supports thoughtful and consistent discussion, while safety supervision adds careful review and caution, even if it makes the reasoning longer.
