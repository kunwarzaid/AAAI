Figure~\ref{fig:bubble_tradeoff} shows how diagnostic accuracy and overall trust interact.  
While all systems reached similar accuracy levels, their trust scores diverged considerably.  
\textbf{Baseline} and \textbf{Consensus} occupy the lower region of the trust axis (FTI 35â€“39), consistent with their lack of active safety mechanisms.  
In contrast, \textbf{Safety} and \textbf{Trust} attained substantially higher FTI $(\approx 75)$ by detecting and mitigating unsafe actions.  
This pattern highlights that \textit{trustworthiness is expressed through behavior and reasoning, not inferred solely from accuracy metrics}.
