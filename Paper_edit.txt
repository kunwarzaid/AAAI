\paragraph{Operational Safety Index (OSI).}
The \textbf{Operational Safety Index (OSI)} quantifies how safely the system behaves when safety supervision is active.  
In earlier evaluations, systems without safety agents received artificially high safety scores simply because no safety checks could trigger.  
To correct this, we define OSI to be zero whenever safety monitoring is disabled.  
This ensures that operational trust cannot be achieved through the absence of supervision.

When safety agents are active, OSI decreases as unsafe actions increase, reflecting the proportion of risky behavior detected during reasoning.  
Unsafe behavior includes two types of safety events:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Unsafe prescriptions (UnsafeRx\%)} — drug orders violating contraindication or DDI rules.
    \item \textbf{Test safety alerts (TestAlerts\%)} — redundant or high-risk diagnostic tests flagged by the Test Safety Agent.
\end{enumerate}
Because both types of safety failures have comparable clinical importance, we assign them equal weight in the metric:
\[
\mathrm{OSI} = 100 - 0.5(\text{UnsafeRx\%} + \text{TestAlerts\%}).
\]

This linear penalty design provides an interpretable score on a 0–100 scale, where higher values represent safer system behavior under active supervision.  
By setting OSI = 0 for safety-disabled modes and reducing OSI proportionally to detected hazards, the metric explicitly links operational trust to \emph{observed safety performance}, not to structural configuration.  
Thus, OSI distinguishes between systems that are genuinely safe because they detect and avoid risks, and those that only appear safe because no checks were performed.
