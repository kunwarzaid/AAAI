\paragraph{Limitations.}
The proposed indices quantify internal reasoning quality and operational prudence, but they do not validate clinical correctness or patient safety outcomes.  
In particular, RDC and ETI capture how coherently and consistently the model reasons, not whether its conclusions are medically accurate.  
Accordingly, the Final Trust Index (FTI) should be interpreted as an indicator of \textit{reasoning trustworthiness}—the extent to which a system reasons transparently and responsibly—rather than as a measure of clinical validity.
