\paragraph{Final Trust Index (FTI).}
The Final Trust Index (FTI) aggregates epistemic reliability and operational prudence into a single measure of overall system trust:
\[
\mathrm{FTI} = 0.5 \times \mathrm{ETI} + 0.5 \times \mathrm{OSI}.
\]
Because the Operational Safety Index (OSI) is defined as zero when safety agents are inactive, this formulation automatically penalizes configurations that lack real safety oversight.  
As a result, systems such as \textbf{Baseline} and \textbf{Consensus} receive lower FTI values even if their accuracy is high, while configurations with active safety supervision (\textbf{Safety}, \textbf{Trust}) can achieve higher trust scores through explicit vigilance.  
This approach ensures that overall trust reflects both reasoning quality and demonstrated safety behavior, rather than numerical artifacts of differing supervision settings.
