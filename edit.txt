\paragraph{Final Trust Index (FTI).}
The Final Trust Index (FTI) provides an integrated measure of overall system reliability by combining epistemic soundness (ETI) and operational prudence (OSI):
\[
\mathrm{FTI} = 0.5 \times \mathrm{ETI} + 0.5 \times \mathrm{OSI}.
\]
Because the Operational Safety Index (OSI) is defined as zero when no safety agents are active, this formulation automatically discounts configurations that operate without real-time supervision.  
Consequently, models such as \textbf{Baseline} and \textbf{Consensus}—which reason correctly but without explicit safety control—receive lower FTI values despite high accuracy.  
In contrast, configurations with active safety oversight (\textbf{Safety} and \textbf{Trust}) achieve higher FTI by demonstrating both coherent reasoning and responsible action.  
This definition ensures that the composite trust score reflects genuine transparency and prudence rather than structural artifacts of system configuration.
\paragraph{Interpretive Framework.}
Taken together, these indices provide a layered perspective on system trust:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Epistemic Trust (ETI):} evaluates whether the model’s reasoning is stable, coherent, and aligned with clinical logic.
    \item \textbf{Operational Trust (OSI):} reflects whether the model acts safely when interventions are permitted.
    \item \textbf{Final Trust (FTI):} integrates both forms of reliability into an overall indicator of responsible reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
In combination, they shift the focus from mere accuracy to the integrity of reasoning processes—an approach more consistent with clinician-auditable standards of reliability.

\subsection{Metric Validation and Reliability}

The proposed metrics were evaluated on 50 simulated clinical cases spanning diagnostic, testing, and prescribing tasks.  
All statistical analyses were performed at the case level ($n{=}50$); system-level comparisons are presented descriptively to illustrate relative behavior rather than to support inferential claims.

\paragraph{Convergent Validity.}
RDC showed positive association with evidence coverage ($r{=}0.56$) and negative association with redundancy ratio ($r{=}-0.62$), suggesting that higher semantic coherence coincides with more complete and less repetitive reasoning.  
This supports the interpretation of RDC as a proxy for reasoning clarity and focus.

\paragraph{Discriminant Validity.}
Case-level correlation between ETI and OSI was weak ($r{=}0.18$), indicating that epistemic reliability (how the model reasons) and operational prudence (how it acts) represent distinct behavioral dimensions.  
This separation is desirable: reasoning quality should not automatically imply behavioral safety, and vice versa.

\paragraph{Ablation Robustness and Weight Justification.}
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:eti_weight_sweep}, the ranking of systems remained stable across a wide range of ETI weight settings, indicating that the metric is not overly sensitive to coefficient choice.  
Further, the component ablation study (Table~\ref{tab:eti_component_ablate}) revealed that removing either CDR or RDC disrupted system ordering and reduced discriminability, confirming that each term contributes essential information.  
Overall, these results suggest that the weighting scheme is both empirically stable and interpretable from a clinical reasoning standpoint.
